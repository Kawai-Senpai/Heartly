## Overview

**Heartly** is a Python application developed with Kivy, designed to evaluate the risk of heart disease based on user inputs developed by [*Ranit Bhowmick*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranitbhowmick/) & [*Sayanti Chatterjee*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayantichatterjee/). The application utilizes a neural network model to predict the likelihood of heart disease, providing a percentage risk based on a series of questions related to the user's health and lifestyle.

## Usage

Upon launching Heartly, users will be presented with a questionnaire covering various health and lifestyle factors. Each response is processed by the neural network model to estimate the risk of heart disease. The application then displays the calculated risk percentage based on the provided answers.

## Technical Details

### Neural Network Model

The core of Heartly's prediction capability is a neural network model implemented using PyTorch. The model consists of 23 fully connected layers with GELU activation functions and dropout for regularization. The architecture is as follows:

- **Layers:**
  - `fc1` to `fc23`: Fully connected layers with decreasing output sizes from 40 to 1.
  - `af` (Activation Function): GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit).
  - `sigmoid`: Sigmoid activation function applied to the final layer's output.
  - `dropout`: Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.05.

**Model Description:**

**Weights:**

The model's weights are pre-trained and loaded into the neural network. Ensure that the weights file (`Heart_disease.CookieNeko`) is present in the application directory for accurate predictions.

### Data Collection

The app collects user responses to various health-related questions. These responses are converted into a numerical format suitable for input into the neural network.

### Risk Calculation

The risk percentage is computed by passing the processed input data through the neural network. The output of the neural network is a probability value between 0 and 1, which is then scaled to a percentage representing the likelihood of heart disease.

### UI/UX Design

The user interface is developed using Kivy, which provides a smooth and interactive experience. The design includes:

- **Questionnaire:** Sequential presentation of questions.
- **Progress Indicator:** Shows the user's progress through the questionnaire.
- **Result Display:** Shows the calculated risk percentage and provides additional information based on the result.

### Error Handling

Heartly includes error handling mechanisms to manage issues such as invalid inputs or failed model loading. Users are provided with clear instructions and prompts to correct any errors.

## Testing

Heartly has undergone rigorous testing to ensure functionality and accuracy. This includes:

- **Unit Tests:** Verifying the correctness of the neural network's prediction function.
- **UI Tests:** Ensuring that all user interface elements operate correctly across different platforms.
- **Integration Tests:** Confirming that data flows correctly from user input to risk calculation.

## Acknowledgements

Heartly was developed with the aim of making heart disease risk assessment accessible to everyone. Thanks to the Kivy and PyTorch communities for providing the tools and support that made this project possible.
